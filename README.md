## hai there! i'm Jax! 🐾

*what are you doing here?*<br>
I'm a full-time furry, aviation enthusiast and programmer who does art ',:3<br>
<br>
I make stuff using NodeJS and Python in my free time!<br>

### some kewl facts about me~
- I'm also known as FluffyCinnabunFolf!
- I am probably the slowest programmer anyone can ever witness..
- I mainly develop with NodeJS and Python!
- I'd love to learn more about TypeScript, PHP, HTML, MySQL and Lua.
- I typically work best independently. It's probably linked to my shyness out in the real world.
